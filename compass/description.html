<h1>Computational Modelling of Primary School Segregation (COMPASS)</h1>

<p>
Interact with the widgets to change the parameter values of the model. Clicking
the reset button will update the changed values. Parameter explanations can be 
found in (Dignum et al., 2022a) and (Dignum et al. 2022b). Take special care in 
setting the 'p' parameter, this resembles at how many meters the utility for distance
becomes 0.5. For the Amsterdam case between 500 and 4000 meters are reasonable values, 
but for the lattice case with size 50 for example, between 10 and 40 might be more suitable. 
Note that not all households are shown (keeps the visualisation fast) and that several 
parameters are enclosed in DOUBLE parentheses, where the first value is for group 1 and the 
next for group 2, otherwise the model will not work. The residential process only runs for 
the 'lattice' case and will run first until convergence or until the maximum amount of steps 
is reached. After this, schools are chosen, taking the residential location as given. For
